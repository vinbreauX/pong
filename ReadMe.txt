PONG v1.0

This is my first complete project in Python.
The goal was to complete a project, not so much to make it perfect.

The ball physics are probably overly complicated and it
still has a few bugs. Also, it could stand having most of the code packed
into functions. I'm still learning.

I plan to continue working with this code, organizing it into
functions, eventually as part of my continuing
python learning.

This code makes use of a font called Alexis which
can be found here: http://www.dafont.com/alexis.font

You can see a video of the code in action on my YouTube channel:
